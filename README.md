  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 20px;">Hi there! I'm Wanyoike Mark Edwards, currently an aspiring full-stack developer. I created this repository to share my knowledge and experience with you. This repo contains, simple, responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 20px;">In this repo, you'll have to install Visual Studio Code and its extensions, and then we'll start from scratch with each project. After finishing HTML, we'll move on to CSS and JavaScript. Building in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript is fine, and this guide will explain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript syntax.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 20px;">Each project in this course is started from scratch and finished without using copied code. Then, we'll go over the code together to ensure that everyone understands. This program's exciting project-based curriculum includes building modern, super cool, and responsive websites!</p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 20px;">If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me via my email: Markeddy254@gmail.com </p>
